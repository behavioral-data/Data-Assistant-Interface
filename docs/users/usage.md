# User Experience

## Adding Comments

Currently, JupyterLab Comments supports cell-level comments and text-selection comments.

### Cell-Level Comments

To add a cell-level comment, right-click on the cell and select `Add Comment`. Fill out the mock comment and press submit.

### Text-Selection Comments

Text selection comments are supported on both Jupyter Notebooks and plain text files (eg. .txt, .py, etc).

#### Jupyter Notebooks

To add a text selection comment to a Jupyter Notebook, either:

1. select the text in the desired cell and click on the blue comment indicator. Fill out the mock comment and press submit.

2. select the text in the desired cell, right-click, and select `Add Comment`. Fill out the mock comment - which should contain the selected text - and press submit.

#### Plain Text Files

Text selection comments in plain text files can be added by selecting text and either right-clicking and selecting `Add Comment`, or clicking on the blue comment indicator.

## Altering Comments

### Editing and Deleting

To either edit or delete a comment, click on the three ellipses on the top right of a comment.

### Replying

Replying to a comment can be done by either:

1. clicking on the three ellipses on the top right of a comment, and clicking `Reply Comment`

2. clicking on an un-focused comment (one which does not have a blue outline) and entering text through the reply box underneath the comment.
