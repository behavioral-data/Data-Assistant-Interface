Features
=========

User Icon and Color
---------------------

Each user on a session has a unique ``identity`` which is designated by the profile picture and color associated with their comments.

A user's name initalizes to ``Anonymous {Jupiter Moon Name}`` but can be altered by clicking on the pencil icon when hovering over your name. User color will be reflected in highlights when making text selection comments.
