# Introduction

Jupyterlab Comments aims to create a medium for communication in the latest release of JupyterLab (3.x.x).

The headlining feature in the newest release of JupyterLab is RTC (Real Time Collaboration) which uses the CRDT by Y.js to enable synchronous/real time capabilities. Our extension `jupyterlab-comments` leverages these capabilities to create a collaborative environment where users can comment on files that they work on in JupyterLab.
